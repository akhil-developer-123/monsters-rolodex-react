# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Personal Notes

order in which things run

    constructor
    render function
    ComponentDidMount lifecycle method


React re-renders a component when either of these 2 events happen
a. setState
b. props change
re-render meaning render() fn is called


React lifecycle methods for class based components
diagram https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/

In short,
ComponentDidMount gets invoked when DOM is mounted everytime
ComponentDidUpdate gets invoked on re-rendering of the component.
  Note: Re-render happens when setState is called
When a component is no longer needed, React will unmount it from DOM. 
  Then ComponentWillUnmount is invoked before that.


Functional components does not have any lifecycle methods 
keywords to consider exploring

Pure fn: If the output of a function is purely dependant on the inputs of the given function.
The output does not change for same inputs.
eg: function funcA(a,b) {return a + b}; 

Impure fn: If the output of a fn is dependant on some variable outside the scope of given function.
The output can change for same inputs.
eg: 
var c = 10;
function funcA(a,b) {return a + b +c};
now, I can change the value of c outside the function. 
lets say, c = 11;
now for same inputs, funcA will produce different outputs.

Side affect: If a fn is modifying/changing something outside the scope of the function its a sideaffect
